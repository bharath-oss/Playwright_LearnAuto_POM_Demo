npx playwright test Basic.spec.js --project=chromium --headed

//falkiness
1.cause when api are not where of dependent api's. 
eg: if we update an row suppose from rat-->rabbit, 
api resposnse don't know what is rat and what is rabbit.
in this case just insert a expect assertion so that it will get pased.

2.cause when dom page is taking much time then playwright expected time.
use page.slower() so that it will slow the execution 3 tmies lower;

3.locators playwirhgt does suggest to nested css and dynmic xpaths in this case we get flakiness.
use getbyRole like this selectors and u won;t face the issue.
